## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Metric | Graph v1 (no filter) | Graph v2 (noise filter) | BAM (no sidecar) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Phased reads | 98.0% | 93.4% | 81.0% |
| Phase sets | 421 | 425 | 431 |
| N50 | 912 Kbp | 898 Kbp | **937 Kbp** |
| Accuracy | 89.73% | 92.77% | **97.02%** |
| Switch error | 6.14% | **1.04%** | 2.28% |
| Perfect PS | 19.0% | 22.9% | **30.9%** |

**Key observations:**
- Noise filter improves graph accuracy +3 pp (89.7% → 92.8%) and cuts switch error 6× (6.14% → 1.04%)
- Noise filter costs ~4.6% phased reads (noisy indels excluded from k-means)
- BAM pipeline still leads on accuracy (97%) and perfect phase sets (30.9%)
- Graph pipeline with noise filter has the lowest switch error rate of all three
- Graph pipeline phases significantly more reads than BAM (93% vs 81%) even after filtering

## Noise Filtering: BAM vs Graph Pipeline

### What we ported

The BAM pipeline's `classify_variant_initial` applies three reference-context checks to
indel candidates:

1. **Homopolymer context** — indel sits in a run of ≥3 copies of a 1–6 bp repeat unit
2. **Tandem repeat context** — deleted/inserted motif matches ≥3 tandem copies in flanking reference
3. **SDUST low-complexity** — variant position falls inside a low-complexity interval

Indels flagged by (1) or (2) become `RepeatHetIndel` and are excluded from k-means phasing
(`lcd_var_i_to_cate = kLongcalldRepHetVar`, which doesn't match `kCandGermlineClean`).

These three checks were extracted into a shared module (`src/noise_filter.hpp/cpp`) and wired
into the graph pipeline via `apply_graph_noise_filter` in `graph_bam_adapter.cpp`. Each worker
thread opens its own `faidx_t`, fetches the chunk's reference slice, and reclassifies
`CleanHetIndel` → `RepeatHetIndel` for noisy sites. The flag behavior matches the BAM pipeline
exactly: `RepeatHetIndel` candidates are excluded from k-means.

### What we did NOT port (and why)

The BAM pipeline has additional filtering stages that depend on **per-read CIGAR error
intervals** — information that doesn't exist in the graph pipeline's GAF input:

| BAM feature | Why it doesn't apply to graph |
|---|---|
| Read-level noisy regions (XID clustering from CIGAR) | GAF allele observations are node-level, not base-aligned. No per-read error intervals. |
| Dense overlap check (`var_pos_cr` n_ov > 1) | Snarl parent-child gating already handles nested/overlapping sites. |
| Noisy-reads-ratio gate | Requires per-read CIGAR error intervals. |
| `post_process_noisy_regs` (widen noisy spans) | Depends on read-level noisy regions. |
| `apply_noisy_containment_filter` (demote contained candidates) | Depends on widened noisy regions. |
| Noisy-region MSA recall (`collect_noisy_vars_step4`) | Requires BAM reads for MSA realignment. |
| Second k-means with `kCandGermlineVarCate` | Only useful after MSA recall produces `NoisyCandHet`. |

### SNPs in low-complexity regions

`is_noisy_site` checks `pos_in_low_complexity` for all variant types, including SNPs. However,
`apply_graph_noise_filter` only reclassifies `CleanHetIndel` candidates — SNPs are not touched.
This matches the BAM pipeline, where SDUST low-complexity intervals are **never used to directly
reclassify any variant**. Instead, they serve a structural role:

1. **Extending noisy region boundaries** — adjacent low-complexity intervals are absorbed into
   read-level noisy spans during `pre_process_noisy_regs_pgphase`.
2. **Extending repeat-indel spans** — when a `RepeatHetIndel` is added to the noisy region tree,
   its genomic span is widened to include overlapping low-complexity intervals.

A SNP can end up filtered in the BAM pipeline, but only **indirectly**: if the low-complexity
region was already part of or adjacent to a noisy region built from read-level error clustering,
and the widened noisy span fully contains the SNP, then `apply_noisy_containment_filter` demotes
it to `NonVariant`. A SNP in a low-complexity region with no nearby read-level noise stays
`CleanHetSnp`.

If we reclassified graph SNPs in low-complexity regions, we'd be **more aggressive** than the
BAM pipeline — potentially removing legitimate het SNPs that are reliable phasing anchors.

### Future work

If the graph pipeline gains access to base-level alignment information (e.g. via surjected BAM
or GAF CIGAR strings), the read-level noisy region pipeline could be ported. Until then, the
reference-context checks are the only applicable noise filter.

## Lessons / Pitfalls

- **pgbam sidecar causes over-stitching:** Running BAM pipeline with `--pgbam-file` merged all 49 initial phase sets into 2 chr20-spanning blocks with near-random accuracy (55%). Do not use the sidecar without understanding its signal quality.
- **Wrong reference = 0 reads:** `hg002v1.1.fasta` (maternal/paternal contigs) does not match the `CHM13#0#chr20` contig name in the aligned BAM. Must use `chm13v2.0.chr20.renamed.fa` as ref for `collect-bam-variation`.
- **Use chr20-only truth refs:** Full-genome maternal/paternal assemblies cause a small fraction of reads to leak to chr1/6/16 during truth alignment. Use `HG002_1.1_MATERNAL.chr20.fasta` / `HG002_1.1_PATERNAL.chr20.fasta` for clean results.
- **Per-chunk site loading:** Graph pipeline uses tabix-indexed per-chunk site queries (commit `5878aad`) — loading all 977K sites upfront was the prior bottleneck.
- **Non-numeric node IDs:** `build_compact_graph_site_index` now skips sites with non-numeric node IDs instead of aborting (commit `5c01954`).
